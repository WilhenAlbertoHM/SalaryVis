            To answer the question, let's explore some data. <br>
            Here are the average salaries of professors, both with good and bad reviews, in the six colleges at UMass Boston:

            We've seen mixed results across the colleges. <br><br>
            What is the conclusion &#128187? <br><br>
            The conclusion is that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: lightgreen">encouraged for everyone to fact check the data themselves.</span>
            Even though the data shows a correlation between rating and salary, 
            it's important to remember that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red">correlation does not imply causation.</span> <br><br>

            <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: violet">An example of this</span> is: in the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: lightblue">College of Nursing</span>, 
            the professors are <span style="text-decoration: underline">full-time nurses</span>.
            This means that some of them are <span style="text-decoration: underline">part-time professors</span>, so they won't get paid as much as full-time professors.
            <br><br>

            Things to mention are that the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: lightsalmon">data is not recently updated</span>,
            as some professors are not listed in the data.
            Also, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: lightsalmon">professor roles matter here</span> as well, 
            so it's important to take them into account when looking at the salary.
            <br><br>

            <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: lightseagreen">We can't blindly believe what we see on the web.</span> <br>
            This was made to encourage people to make sense out of data themselves 
            and find out why things are the way they are, taking into account many factors.
